**Codility**
===================

Since Codility does tests for employers, I figured it would be a good way to keep my programming and algorithmic skills polished.
All solutions are sorted by the lesson/challenge, and the multiple files in each folder are for multiple languages.

Due to the copyright of the actual problem statement, I will have brief summaries of each problem in a Readme.txt file in each folder.
If more information regarding the lesson/challenge is needed, please visit the codility website.

I hope the included Lessons and Challenges help demonstrate my ability to code well.
