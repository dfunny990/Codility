**Codility**
===================

Since Codility does tests for employers, I figured it would be a good way to keep my programming and algorithmic skills polished.
All solutions are sorted by the lesson/challenge, and the multiple files in each folder are for multiple languages.

Each lesson/challenge has it's own folder with a readme.txt file which includes the problem statement.

I hope the included Lessons and Challenges help demonstrate my ability to code well.
